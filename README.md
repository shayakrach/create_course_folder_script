# Create_Your_Course_Folder_Script

how it works: 

You just need to write the name of your course.


cmd: create-course-folder.bat <Your_Course_Folder_Name>

terminal: bash create-course-folder.sh <Your_Course_Folder_Name>


The script will make the HW, Lectures, FinalExam and Recitations folders.

In the HW folder the script will make 13 folders, for every week in the semester.
